//! Understory Responder: a deterministic, `no_std` router for UI events.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This crate builds the responder chain sequence — capture → target → bubble — from pre‑resolved hits.
//! It does not perform hit testing.
//! Instead, feed it [`ResolvedHit`](crate::types::ResolvedHit) items (for example from a box tree or a 3D ray cast), and it emits a deterministic propagation sequence you can dispatch.
//!
//! ## Inputs
//!
//! Provide one or more [`ResolvedHit`](crate::types::ResolvedHit) values for candidate targets.
//! A [`ResolvedHit`](crate::types::ResolvedHit) contains the node key, an optional root→target `path`, a [`DepthKey`](crate::types::DepthKey) used for ordering,
//! a [`Localizer`](crate::types::Localizer) for coordinate conversion, and an optional `meta` payload (e.g., text or ray‑hit details).
//! You may also provide a [`ParentLookup`](crate::types::ParentLookup) source to reconstruct a path when `path` is absent.
//!
//! ## Ordering
//!
//! Candidates are ranked by [`DepthKey`](crate::types::DepthKey).
//! For `Z`, higher is nearer. For `Distance`, lower is nearer. When kinds differ, `Z` ranks above `Distance` by default.
//! Equal‑depth ties are stable and the router selects the last.
//!
//! ## Pointer capture
//!
//! If capture is set, the router routes to the captured node regardless of fresh hits.
//! It uses the matching hit’s path and `meta` if present, otherwise reconstructs a path with [`ParentLookup`](crate::types::ParentLookup) or falls back to a singleton path.
//! Capture bypasses scope filtering.
//!
//! ## Layering
//!
//! The router only computes the traversal order. A higher‑level dispatcher can execute handlers, honor cancelation, and apply toolkit policies.
//!
//! ## Workflow
//!
//! 1) Pick candidates — e.g., from a 2D box tree or a 3D ray cast — and build
//!    one or more [`ResolvedHit`](crate::types::ResolvedHit) values (with optional root→target paths).
//! 2) Route — [`Router`](crate::router::Router) ranks candidates by [`DepthKey`](crate::types::DepthKey) and selects
//!    exactly one target. It emits a capture→target→bubble sequence for that target’s path.
//!    - Overlapping siblings: only the topmost/nearest candidate is selected; siblings do not receive the target.
//!    - Equal‑depth ties: deterministic and stable; the last candidate wins unless you pre‑order your hits or set a policy.
//!    - Pointer capture: overrides selection until released.
//! 3) Hover — derive the path from the dispatch via [`path_from_dispatch`](crate::hover::path_from_dispatch)
//!    and feed it to [`HoverState`](crate::hover::HoverState). `HoverState` emits leave (inner→outer)
//!    and enter (outer→inner) events for the minimal transition between old and new paths.
//! 4) Click — use [`ClickState`](crate::click::ClickState) (requires `box_tree_adapter` feature) to track
//!    press-release pairs and recognize clicks based on distance and time constraints. Use `on_move`
//!    during pointer movement to filter out nodes that exceed movement thresholds, and `on_up` to
//!    determine final click recognition. This handles scenarios where targets move between pointer
//!    down and up events.
//!
//! ## Focus
//!
//! Focus routing is separate from pointer routing.
//! Use [`Router::dispatch_for`](router::Router::dispatch_for) to emit a capture → target → bubble sequence for the focused node.
//! The router reconstructs the root→target path via [`ParentLookup`](crate::types::ParentLookup) or falls back to a singleton path.
//! Use [`FocusState`](crate::focus::FocusState) to compute `Enter(..)` and `Leave(..)` transitions between old and new focus paths.
//! Keyboard and IME events typically route to focus and may bypass scope filters by policy at a higher layer.
//! Click‑to‑focus can be implemented by setting focus after a pointer route and then routing subsequent key input via `dispatch_for`.
//!
//! ## Dispatcher
//!
//! Execute handlers over the responder sequence and honor stop/cancelation with [`dispatcher::run`].
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use understory_responder::dispatcher;
//! use understory_responder::types::{Dispatch, Outcome, Phase};
//! # #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)] struct Node(u32);
//! # let seq: Vec<Dispatch<Node, (), ()>> = vec![
//! #     Dispatch::capture(Node(1)),
//! #     Dispatch::target(Node(1)),
//! #     Dispatch::bubble(Node(1)),
//! # ];
//! let mut default_prevented = false;
//! let stop_at = dispatcher::run(&seq, &mut default_prevented, |d, flag| {
//!     if matches!(d.phase, Phase::Target) {
//!         *flag = true;
//!     }
//!     Outcome::Continue
//! });
//! assert!(stop_at.is_none());
//! assert!(default_prevented);
//! ```
//!
//! See the `dispatcher` module docs for additional patterns and helpers.
//!
//! ## Adapters
//!
//! The [`adapters`] module provides integration with other Understory crates:
//!
//! - **Box Tree Adapter** (`box_tree_adapter` feature): Converts `understory_box_tree` spatial queries
//!   into [`ResolvedHit`](types::ResolvedHit) items. Key components:
//!   - Spatial query helpers: [`adapters::box_tree::top_hit_for_point`] and [`adapters::box_tree::hits_for_rect`]
//!   - Navigation support: [`adapters::box_tree::navigation`] for filtered tree traversal and keyboard focus cycling
//!   - Click integration: [`adapters::box_tree::ClickAdapter`] for automatic node bounds lookup with [`ClickState`](crate::click::ClickState)
//!
//! This crate is `no_std` and uses `alloc`.
